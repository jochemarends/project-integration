\section{Assignment 2}
Show that the ESP32 can turn three different LEDs on and off separately by sending commands over the serial interface.

\subsection{Toolchain}
Just like the previous one, for this assignment I have used the ESP-IDF toolchain.
The ESP-IDF toolchain provides good \cpluspluslogo{} support.
From the UART can be read using \texttt{std::cin}, but to get the usual behaviour, our program needs to initialize the UART driver first.
