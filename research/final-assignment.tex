\section{Final Assignment}
For the final assignment, I'm managing a database using SQL and will insert data using an ESP32.
I chose this assignment because there's a high chance the ESP32 has to communicate with a database in the final product.

\subsection{Software Architecture}
The software exists of three major components, The ESP32 which acts as an \gls{http} client, a \gls{http} server, and a database, of which the \gls{http} server and the database are hosted a Raspberry Pi.
