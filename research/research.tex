\section{Introduction}
As part of Project Integration, \gls{acs} students need to conduct research about the ESP32 microcontroller.
Upon completion of this research, a set of assignments have to be completed.
First, some introductory assignments have to be done in order to familiarize ourselves with concepts that are important for the project.
At the end of the research, each student works on a final assignment that goes more in depth of a specific topic.

\section{Assignment 1}
Show that the ESP32 can turn three different LEDs on and off seperately using an internal loop with delays.
