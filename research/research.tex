\section{Introduction}
As part of Project Integration, \gls{acs} students need to conduct research about the ESP32 microcontroller.
Upon completion of this research, a set of assignments have to be completed.
First, some introductory assignments in order to familiarize ourselves with concepts that are important for the project, followed by a final assignment that goes more in depth into specific topics that are of value for our final product.

\section{The ESP32}
The ESP32 is a series of microcontrollers developed by Espressif Systems that have integrated \gls{wifi} and \gls{bluetooth} modules \cite{esp32-ds}.

\section{Espressif}
Espressif Systems is a multinational semiconductor company that focusses among other things on developing wireless communication and \gls{aiot} \cite{aboutespressif}.
Popular products Espressif created, are the ESP32 series of chips, development boards, and modules \cite{aboutespressif}.
Espressif supports various open-source software projects such as \glspl{sdk}, libraries, and tools.
Espressif is a chinese company but has offices all around the world \cite{aboutespressif}.
