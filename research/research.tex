\section{Introduction}
As part of Project Integration, \gls{acs} students need to conduct research about the ESP32 microcontroller.
Upon completion of this research, a set of assignments have to be completed.
First, some introductory assignments have to be done in order to familiarize ourselves with concepts that are important for the project.
At the end of the research, each student works on a final assignment that goes more in depth into a specific topic.

\section{The ESP32}
The ESP32 is a microcontroller developed by Espressif.
The ESP32 has integrated \gls{wifi} and \gls{bluetooth} modules.

\section{Espressif}
Espressif Systems is a multinational semiconductor company that focusses among other things on developing wireless communication and \gls{aiot}.
